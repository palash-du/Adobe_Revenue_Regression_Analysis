# Regression Project on Adobe Inc's Quarterly Revenue

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the comprehensive regression analysis project aimed at finding the optimal statistical model for predicting Adobe Inc.'s quarterly revenue. The project delves into identifying significant factors influencing the revenue and applies various statistical tests to forecast future trends with historical data.

## Software Used

- **Minitab**: All aspects of the data analysis, including data preparation, statistical testing, regression modeling, and diagnostics, were performed using Minitab. This software facilitated the comprehensive statistical analysis and model validation processes detailed in this project.

## Analysis Approach

The study follows a systematic approach broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Organizing and cleaning data related to Adobe Inc.'s quarterly revenue alongside various potential influencing factors.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting initial analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and initial insights from the data.
3. **Model Building and Selection**:
    - Performing regression analyses to understand the relationships between different predictors and Adobe Inc.'s revenue.
    - Evaluating multiple models to select the best one based on statistical and practical significance.
4. **Statistical Testing and Model Validation**:
    - **Multicollinearity**: Assessing and addressing multicollinearity among independent variables to ensure the stability of the regression coefficients.
    - **Outlier Detection**: Identifying outliers and assessing their impact on the model's performance.
    - **Normality Checks**: Testing the normality of residuals to validate the regression assumptions.
    - **Heteroscedasticity**: Evaluating the consistency of variance in the residuals across different values of the independent variables.
    - **Autocorrelation**: Checking for correlation between residual errors, which is particularly important in time-series data.
    - **Curvilinearity**: Examining and incorporating non-linear relationships between the predictors and the dependent variable, if necessary.
5. **Model Refinement**: Iteratively refining the model by excluding non-significant predictors and optimizing for predictive accuracy and interpretability.
6. **Prediction and Conclusion**: Utilizing the finalized model to predict Adobe Inc.'s future quarterly revenues and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights.
